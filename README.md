# grapic-standalone
**grapic-standalone** is a very simple makefile made to compile apps that use the [Grapic](https://github.com/ucacaxm/grapic) library.

## Usage
Clone the repo, edit `main.cpp` to your liking, then run `make`. It will generate a `main` file in the `build` directory, which you can execute to run your program.

Run `make clean` to remove all build files.
